## A free dinosaur mod for 1.20.1 and 1.21.1, inspired by the classic JurassiCraft experience – no paywalls, no nonsense.
## 📦 About the Mod:
Jurassic Revived is a fan-made dinosaur mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 and 1.21.1, inspired by the gameplay and features of the original JurassiCraft mod.

More species may be added over time.

## 💡 Why Jurassic Revived?
When JurassiCraft went private and its downloads disappeared, this mod was made to continue the legacy — for the community, by the community. Jurassic Revived offers the same immersive dinosaur gameplay — without restrictions.

This is a fan project and is not affiliated with the newer JurassiCraft team (everything that appears in this mod comes either from the assets that the former team members have provided us with or was directly created by us) or any associated franchises. The mod is non-commercial and only inspired by the legacy of JurassiCraft.
